It has recently attracted substantial interest from investors due to its underlying Philosophy of decentralization and transparency. Considering cryptocurrency’s volatility and unique characteristics, accurate price prediction is essential for developing successful investment strategies. To this end, this model predicts the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum, a dominant cryptocurrency. Most of the existing models attention are exclusive on Bitcoin Cryptocurrency. But there are numerous popular crypto-currencies other than bitcoin. The suggested model will be able to predict all the vital crypto-currencies prices with great accuracy. Many parameters will be opted into account to predict the prices validly. For stable prediction performance in unseen price range, the change point detection technique is employed. In addition, on-chain data, the unique records listed on the blockchain that are inherent in cryptocurrencies, are collected and utilized as input variables to predict prices. Experiments with real-world BTC price data and various method setups have proven the proposed framework’s effectiveness in BTC price prediction.
